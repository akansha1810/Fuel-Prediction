Fuel Consumption Prediction 🚗⛽
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict fuel consumption based on vehicle characteristics and performance parameters. The goal is to leverage historical data to provide insights into fuel efficiency and enable smarter decision-making for both consumers and manufacturers.

📊 Dataset

Source: Provided dataset (structured in tabular form).

Key Features (Independent Variables):

Vehicle characteristics (e.g., engine size, cylinders, weight, horsepower, model year, etc.)

Performance-related metrics.

Target Variable:

Fuel Consumption / MPG (Miles Per Gallon) – continuous numeric value.

🔑 Project Workflow

The end-to-end pipeline of this project consists of the following steps:

Data Collection

Imported dataset for training and evaluation.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values.

Dropped irrelevant/duplicate features.

Converted categorical columns into numeric representations using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated statistical summaries.

Visualized correlations using heatmaps, scatter plots, and pairplots.

Checked feature importance and multicollinearity.

Feature Engineering

Scaled numerical variables using StandardScaler.

Encoded categorical variables.

Split dataset into train/test sets.

Model Building

Applied multiple machine learning models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Evaluated performance using:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RMSE

Model Selection

Compared models and selected the best-performing one for predictions.

Deployment (Optional)

Built a simple Streamlit app / Flask API for user interaction.

Users can input vehicle attributes and get predicted fuel consumption.

📈 Results

Best-performing model achieved an R² score of 0.0263 on test data.

Identified most significant features impacting fuel consumption (e.g., engine size, cylinders, vehicle weight).
